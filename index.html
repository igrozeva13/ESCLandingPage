  <div class="Q1">
    <h3>Q: What are your Health Care options?</h3>
    <p>
A: Your first plan option is a Fixed Indemnity Medical Plan. This plan pays a specified amount of money per day based on the service provided, regardless of the cost of the service. For those that participate in the medical plan, dental, vision, disability and life benefits are also available for election. Enrolling in the Fixed Indemnity Medical Plan does not satisfy the Individual Mandate and you will be subject to the federal tax. This plan allows you to receive a subsidy from the Health Insurance Exchange.

	Your second plan option is the MEC Wellness/Preventive Plan. This plan covers wellness and preventative services, such as immunization and routine health screening, only. This plan is in compliance with ACA rules and regulations, but it does not cover medical services or conditions caused by accident or illness. Enrolling in the MEC Wellness/Preventive Plan satisfies the Individual Mandate and you will not be taxed for failing to purchase insurance required by the Affordable Care Act. This plan does not allow you to receive a subsidy from the Health Insurance Exchange.

	You may cancel or reduce coverage at any time. You will only have 30 days from your hire date or first paycheck date to enroll, add additional benefits or add additional insured members. After this time frame, you will only be allowed to enroll, add benefits or add additional insured members during your annual open enrollment period or within 30 days of a qualifying life event.
